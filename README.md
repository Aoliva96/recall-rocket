## Introduction

The concept for RecallRocket was inspired by our shared experience learning MERN stack concepts in the EdX full-stack bootcamp we were participating in. RecallRocket took shape as a flashcard study tool to help new developers and seasoned devs alike review their MongoDB, Express, React and Node skills!

## Problem

As a team, we were tasked with creating an application that utilized React.js for the frontend UI, MongoDB for the database, and GraphQL/Apollo server to handle the backend interactions, as well as handling user logins with JSON web tokens.

## Solution

We created an application that allows for self-study of the core concepts of the MERN stack and allows users to create their own cards, once logged in. Future functionality should include the ability to rate the difficulty of cards, view other user's profiles, multiple choice timed quizzes, a leaderboard for the timed quizzes, and a dark/light mode.

See below for some screenshots of our application:
