# RecallRocket

A flashcard application, focused on the Mongo, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN) "stack".

## Description

RecallRocket is an application intended to be a useful tool for new developers to develop their MERN stack skills, and to allow more experienced coders to brush up on the basics as well.

## Introduction

Our app is a flashcard website that allows a user to study computer coding concepts, primarily in the MERN stack, and also allows the user to create an account and then create their own cards.

## Problem

We wanted to make a site that lets us review our knowledge gained from our edX Bootcamp so that we could can reinforce what we have learned about the MERN stack.

## Solution

We created an application that allows for self-study of the core concepts of the MERN stack and allows users to create their own cards, once logged in. Future functionality should include the ability to rate the difficulty of cards, view other user's profiles, multiple choice quizes that are timed, a leaderboard for the timed quizes, and a dark/light mode.

Here are some screeenshots of our application:
