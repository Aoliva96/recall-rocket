    "question": "What is middleware in Express.js?",
    "answer": "Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle.",
    "concept": "express"
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you define routes in Express.js?",
    "answer": "Routes in Express.js are defined by using the app.METHOD(path, handler) function, where METHOD is an HTTP request method such as GET, POST or PUT, and path is a path on the server such as /api/users/1.",
    "concept": "express"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of app.use() in Express.js?",
    "answer": "The app.use() function is used to mount the specified middleware function or functions at the specified path. If path is not specified, it defaults to '/' and the middleware function is executed for every request to the app.",

  {
    "question": "How do you send a response in Express.js?",
    "answer": "In Express.js, you can use the res.send(body) or res.json(body) methods to send a response to the client. The res.send() method sends the HTTP response. The body parameter can be a string, buffer, object, or array. The res.json() method sends a JSON response. It converts the given parameter to a JSON string using JSON.stringify() and sets the Content-Type header to application/json.",

    "concept": "express"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the next() function in Express.js?",
    "answer": "The next() function is used to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack. If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function.",
    "concept": "express"
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you serve static files in Express.js?",
    "answer": "In Express.js, you can use the express.static built-in middleware function to serve static files. You pass the name of the directory that contains the static assets to the express.static middleware function to start serving the files directly.",
    "concept": "express"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a template engine in Express.js?",
    "answer": "A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client.",
